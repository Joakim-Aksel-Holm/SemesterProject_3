# ST3-PRO â€“ Cyber-Physical Systems Project

## Overview
This project is part of the 3rd semester Software Technology Engineering program at the **University of Southern Denmark**.  
The goal is to design and implement a **Cyber-Physical System (CPS)** that controls and monitors a production process.

Case study: **PLC-controlled beer production system** (simulated + real machine).  
Students will build an **IT infrastructure** that collects production data and sends control commands.

## Learning Objectives
Integrates knowledge from:
- **ST3-ICPS**: PLC programming, OPC-UA, SCADA, Industry 4.0, IoT.
- **ST3-CLA**: Data analysis, plotting, optimization, linear algebra.
- **SI3-OD**: Distributed systems, Docker/Kubernetes, networking, publish-subscribe.
- **SI3-WT**: Web technologies, REST APIs, frontend & backend development, web security.

## Project Case
- Implement software to control and monitor a **PLC-based beer production system**.
- Begin with a **simulator** (Windows-only) before connecting to the real machine.
- Develop a **distributed architecture** with integration of automation, data, and control.
- Build **web-based interfaces** for monitoring and interaction.
- Apply **mathematical tools** to improve precision.
